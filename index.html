                        <h1>End of Support</h1>
                        <p><br>Dear community,<br><br>

                        <b>Earlier this year, WhatsApp announced plans to end support for Nokia S40 devices by the end of the year.</b> These credentials are the ones that Disa's WhatsApp plugin uses to connect to WhatsApp servers. Since then, I've done a lot of research on attempting to move all of Disa's users over to iPhone, Android or Windows Phone credentials in attempt to continue support for the plugin well beyond 2016. This was a great deal of work as the new authentication system that these platforms used had to be reverse-engineered and implemented.<br><br>

                        All was going really well with the new authentication system running on the iPhone credentials, until people started getting banned for contacting people on WhatsApp they have never spoken with before. After trying many different tactics (including trying all the possible platform credentials) in attempt to rectify these bans, I realized that WhatsApp was monitoring push notification tokens - a special number that a platform generates based on the signature of the official application. <b>These tokens can only be generated by an official application. If an invalid token is generated or none is specified, the WhatsApp servers will eventually ban any client that attempts to connect.</b> Up until now, Disa's WhatsApp was able to circumvent specifying a token because the Nokia S40 devices did not actually have a push notification system.<br><br>

                        Therefore, to protect the many users using Disa's WhatsApp plugin from getting banned, <b>Disa's WhatsApp support will end in alignment with WhatsApp's plans to end Nokia S40 devices - until the end of December 31, 2016.</b><br><br>

                        If you are using Disa's WhatsApp as a WhatsApp replacement, I recommend that you switch to the official WhatsApp as soon as possible.<br><br>

                        I am sorry for any inconvenience this has caused - it has been my great pleasure of providing a third-party implementation of WhatsApp for the past two years.<br><br>

                        If one day WhatsApp decides to remove their banning system, I will continue to support Disa's WhatsApp in a heartbeat.<br><br>
